We're coming up on the end of the year, and Letterbook has come a very long way. We have architecture and data models that will carry us for a long time into the future. We have a growing set of core backend functionality. We have a logo, colors, and seeds for a visual identity and language for Letterbook as a product. We've conducted moderator experience research, and we're actively designing and building moderation and safety features based on that research. I will always want this project to move farther and faster, but this has been a good year. So let's take stock of what we have and don't have, because I think that will illuminate our most pressing needs.
