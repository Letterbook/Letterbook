# Technical Docs

The Letterbook project makes use of [Architecture Decision Records][adr] to discuss and document substantial technical decisions. ADRs allow us to document our intentions and the reasoning behind our decisions, as we're making them. This has worked well for the project. These make up the bulk of our documentation, at the moment.
