[CreatorKit](https://servicestack.net/creatorkit/) is a simple, customizable alternative solution to using Mailchimp for accepting and managing website
newsletter subscriptions and other mailing lists, sending rich emails with customizable email layouts and templates to your
Customers and subscribers using your preferred SMTP provider of choice.

It also provides a private alternative to using Disqus to enhance websites with threading and commenting on your preferred
blog posts and website pages you want to be able to collaborate with your community on.

### Enhance static websites

We're developing CreatorKit as an ideal companion for JAMStack or statically generated branded websites like
[Razor SSG](https://razor-ssg.web-templates.io/posts/razor-ssg)
enabling you to seamlessly integrate features such as newsletter subscriptions, email management, comments, voting,
and moderation into your existing websites without the complexity of a custom solution, that's ideally suited for Websites
who want to keep all Mailing Lists Contacts and Authenticated User Comments in a different site, isolated from your
existing Customer Accounts and internal Systems.

With CreatorKit, you can enjoy the convenience of managing your blog's comments, votes, and subscriptions directly
from your own hosted [CreatorKit Portal](https://creatorkit.netcore.io/portal/) without needing to rely on complex content 
management systems to manage your blog's interactions with your readers.

Additionally, CreatorKit makes it easy to send emails and templates to different mailing lists, making it the perfect
tool for managing your email campaigns. Whether you're a blogger, marketer, or entrepreneur, CreatorKit is a great
solution for maximizing your blog's functionality and engagement.

## Features

The CreatorKit Portal offers a complete management UI to manage mailing lists, email newsletter and marketing campaigns,
thread management and moderation workflow.

### Use for FREE

CreatorKit is a FREE customizable .NET App included with [ServiceStack](https://servicestack.net) which is
[Free for Individuals and Open Source projects](https://servicestack.net/free) or for organizations that continue to
host their forked CreatorKit projects on GitHub or GitLab. As a stand-alone hosted product there should be
minimal need for any customizations with initial [Mailining Lists, Subscribers](/creatorkit/install#before-you-run),
[App Settings](/creatorkit/install#whats-included) and branding information maintained in
customizable [CSV](/creatorkit/install#before-you-run) and [text files](/creatorkit/customize).

To get started follow the [installation instructions](/creatorkit/install) to download and configure it with your
organization's website settings.

## Future

As we're using CreatorKit ourselves to power all dynamic Mailing List and Comment System features on
[https://servicestack.net](servicestack.net), we'll be continuing to develop it with useful features to
empower static websites with more generic email templates and potential to expand it with commerce features, inc.
Stripe integration, products & subscriptions, ordering system, invoicing, quotes, PDF generation, etc.

Follow [@ServiceStack](https://twitter.com/ServiceStack), Watch or Star [NetCoreApps/CreatorKit](https://github.com/NetCoreApps/CreatorKit)
or Join our CreatorKit-powered Monthly Newsletter to follow and keep up to date with new features:

<div class="not-prose">
    <div class="mt-8 mx-auto max-w-md" data-mail="JoinMailingList" data-props="{ submitLabel:'Join our newsletter' }"></div>
</div>

As a design goal [CreatorKit's components](/creatorkit/components) will be easily embeddable into any external website,
where it will be integrated into the [Razor SSG](/posts/razor-ssg) project template to serve as a working demonstration
and reference implementation. As such it's a great option if you're looking to create a Fast, FREE, CDN hostable,
[simple, modern](/posts/javascript) statically generated website created with Razor & Markdown
like [ServiceStack/servicestack.net](https://github.com/ServiceStack/servicestack.net).

### Feedback welcome

If you'd like to prioritize features you'd like to see first or propose new, generically useful features for
static websites, please let us know in [servicestack.net/ideas](https://servicestack.net/ideas).
