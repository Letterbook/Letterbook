/// This class exists to allow AutoMapper configs to benefit from Dependency Injection. Specifically, from IOptions.
///
/// At some level, it is redundant with the built-in UseAutoMapper() DI extension. We're not using that, because it's likely that we'll want
/// multiple mappings from one type to another. We already need it in ActivityPub. The built-in doesn't support that. It scans for
/// Mapper Profiles in the given assemblies, and composes them all into a single MapperConfig. A config can only support 1 mapping of
/// Tx -> Ty. So we need to have multiple configs, and hence this class.
